                <h1>Game Analysis</h1>
                <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #ff6600;">Game Analysis: Super MarioKart
                    (1992)</h3>
                <hr />
                <h4>Look and listen in the game</h4>
                <p>
                    <em style="color: #0000ff;">The music and in-game options give the game an
                        illusion of being in a Mario Kart world. The features allow users to choose
                        a character and one of three racing maps.</em>
                </p>
                <h4>Simplicity and Complexity of Settings</h4>
                <p>
                    <em style="color: #0000ff;">The settings are pretty basic with not much depth to
                        them.</em>
                </p>
                <h4>Character Control and Interaction</h4>
                <p>
                    <em style="color: #0000ff;">You can control any of the Super Mario Kart
                        characters, including Mario, Princess Peach, Bowser, Toad, Yoshi, and Donkey
                        Kong. Their designs are distinctive and noticeable. There aren't many
                        interactions with non-playable characters (NPCs) as they primarily just race
                        alongside you.</em>
                </p>
                <h4>Game Challenge</h4>
                <p>
                    <em style="color: #0000ff;">The main challenge is to beat the other characters
                        to get first place. The player chooses a character and a kart and then tries
                        to finish in the best position.</em>
                </p>
                <h4>Interacting with Objects</h4>
                <p>
                    <em style="color: #0000ff;">Objects in the game include a mystery box that
                        provides power-ups to use against other players.</em>
                </p>
                <h4>Music and Sounds</h4>
                <p>
                    <em style="color: #0000ff;">The music and sounds are great, featuring classic
                        Mario music that is easily recognizable. The sounds when rounding a corner
                        or hitting a mystery box are very cool and effective.</em>
                </p>
                <h4>Real-world Reflection</h4>
                <p>
                    <em style="color: #0000ff;">The game doesn't have much of a real-world response
                        or commentary. The racing courses have grass, blue skies, and flowers, but
                        they are very cartoon-ish, as expected.</em>
                </p>
                <h4>Future Development</h4>
                <p>
                    <em style="color: #0000ff;">In the future, the graphics and game mechanics could
                        be improved to be smoother.</em>
                </p>
